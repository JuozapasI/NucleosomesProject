Nucleosome Positioning Steps:

1. Get raw data

/ We will start with data of healthy individuals / 

2. Map reads

/ To do the mapping we will try to use nf-core pipelines and will try Nextflow to put our pipeline together;  
After mapping we will take just one chromosome to work through the rest of the steps. We better identify a chromosome that has marker genes of the lymphoid or myeloid genes /

3. Compute windowed protection score (WPS) for each genomic coordinate:
	for coordinate x:
		count number of fragments that spans 120bp window (i.e. starts before x-60 and ends after x+60)
		substract number of fragments that have endpoints in 120bp window (i.e. have one or both endpoints in the interval [x-60,x+60])
4. Apply peak-calling algorithm to find local maxima:
	L-WPS is locally adjusted to a running median of zero in 1 kb windows and smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter
	(window size 21, second-order polynomial) (???) 

/ response to ???  "Locally adjusted to a running median of zero in 1 kb windows" : correct if wrong - in each non overlapping 1000 bases long consecutive windows we compute a median of WPS values and subtract it fom each WPS value in the window/ response to ???  " smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter " :  the program for the filter is available https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.savgol_filter.html , however a paper is not free https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac60214a047, there is another article along the same lines https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.1c00054 , not sure if it is sufficient. / 

	L-WPS track is then segmented into above-zero regions (allowing up to five consecutive positions below zero)
	
	If resulting region is 50-150bp:
		identify median of this region
		"search for the maximum-sum contiguous window above the median" (???)

/ response to ??? : in the resulting region x is position, v is the value at that position,  we compute a sum of values v at the spans of contiguous consecutive positions x . Then we compare these sums with the median. If the sum is above the median , then we remember and record that window  as it is in the following " save start, end and center coordinates ..." /  

save start, end, and center coordinates of this window as the 'peak'
	If resulting region is 150-450bp:
		apply the same approach as in 50-150bp case, but report only those windows that are 50-150bp
	Discard regions that are <50 or >450
	
	A score for each peak is determined as the distance between maximum value in the window
	and the average of the two adjacent L-WPS minima neighboring the region.
	
5. Compute median peak-to-peak spacing within 100kb windows (non-overlapping) in compartments A and B separatelly
	(this will not be used in subsequent steps)

6. Recalculate WPS scores on long (120-180bp, using 120bp window) and short (35-80bp, using 16bp windows) reads separatelly

7. Compare L-WPS and S-WPS scores with data available from databases (ENSEMBLE)

8. Examine peak-to-peak distance withis DHS sites.
	By the comparison spacing of the different DHS sites (corresponding to various cell types), we are able to induce tissue of the origin
	
9. Examine peak-to-peak distance in TSS sites.

10. Perform fast Fourier Transform on the L-WPS across the first 10kb of gene bodies.
